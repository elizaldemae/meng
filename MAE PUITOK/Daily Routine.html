    <p><i> Yes, I'm a working student and my whole day ends <br/>
    with waking up at 7 A.M in the morning <br/>
    to go to work, and leaving at 12 to go to school since my<br/>
    schedule at school is usually only in the afternoon.<br/>
    Then after that I will go to eat and rest<br/>
    then I will do my pending activities at school.<br/>
